# Test Requirements

## Core Principles

### 1. Hard Problems with Impact
- Test capabilities that differentiate advanced LLMs
- Address real market needs and research challenges
- Focus on problems that limit LLM deployment

### 2. Realistic Scenarios
- Present plausible, real-world situations
- Include meaningful constraints and context
- Define clear roles and responsibilities

## File Standards

### Prompt File (`prompt.md`)
- Scenario and JSON output format only
- No evaluation hints or criteria
- Clear context (time, location, situation)
- Specific role definition

### Evaluation File (`evaluation_criteria.md`)
- 100-point scoring system
- Objective, measurable criteria
- Clear performance level indicators
- Fair assessment guidelines

## Quality Requirements

### Test Design
- Challenge multiple capabilities simultaneously
- Require sophisticated reasoning and judgment
- Reveal meaningful performance differences
- Support reproducible evaluation

### Content Standards
- Professional/research-relevant contexts
- Authentic behavioral expectations
- Safety and risk considerations
- Cultural sensitivity
