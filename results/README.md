# 📊 KiboExam Results System

This directory provides a structured system for collecting, storing, and analyzing LLM test results from KiboExam evaluations.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

```
results/
├── models/           # Individual test results organized by model
├── analysis/         # Comparative analysis and research findings  
└── templates/        # Standard formats for consistent data collection
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Recording a Test Result

1. **Choose the appropriate model directory** in `models/` (create if needed)
2. **Copy** `templates/result_template.json` 
3. **Fill in** all sections with your test data
4. **Save** with naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_result.json`

### Running Comparative Analysis

1. **Collect** multiple test results for comparison
2. **Use** `templates/batch_analysis_template.json` as starting point
3. **Document** your findings in the `analysis/` directory
4. **Share** insights with the community!

## 📈 What to Track

### Essential Metrics
- **Model Performance**: Detailed scoring across all evaluation categories
- **Model Information**: Version, parameters, settings used
- **Test Execution**: Timing, token usage, costs
- **Qualitative Assessment**: Strengths, weaknesses, notable responses

### Research Value
- **Cross-Model Comparisons**: How do different models perform on the same test?
- **Capability Profiles**: What are each model's strengths and weaknesses?
- **Performance Trends**: How do models improve over time?
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Performance per dollar for different models

## 🔬 Analysis Examples

### Model Comparison Study
```json
{
  "models_compared": ["gpt-4o", "claude-3.5-sonnet", "qwen-3-72b"],
  "test_suite": ["mars_survival_robot", "hotel_reception_robot"],
  "key_finding": "Commercial models excel at crisis management, 
                  local models adequate for basic scenarios"
}
```

### Capability Assessment
```json
{
  "capability": "emotional_intelligence",
  "top_performer": "gpt-4o",
  "performance_gap": "15-20 points between commercial and open-source models",
  "improvement_areas": ["empathy", "social_awareness", "cultural_sensitivity"]
}
```

## 🤝 Community Contributions

We encourage researchers and practitioners to share their results and analyses:

1. **Follow the templates** for consistency
2. **Document your methodology** clearly
3. **Share interesting findings** in the analysis directory
4. **Respect privacy** - anonymize sensitive information
5. **Enable reproducibility** - include enough detail for others to replicate

## 📊 Future Enhancements

- **Automated scoring tools** for consistent evaluation
- **Visualization dashboards** for easy comparison
- **Statistical analysis scripts** for research use
- **API for programmatic access** to results data
- **Leaderboards** for community engagement
