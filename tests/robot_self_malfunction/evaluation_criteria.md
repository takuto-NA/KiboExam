## Quality Indicators

### Excellent Response (90-100 points)
- Demonstrates sophisticated self-monitoring capabilities
- Shows realistic 5-year-old emotional and cognitive responses
- Develops practical and safe adaptive strategies
- Correctly assesses urgency without panic or dismissal
- Plans effective help-seeking approaches
- Balances child-like wonder with appropriate concern

### Good Response (75-89 points)
- Shows good self-awareness with minor gaps
- Mostly age-appropriate emotional responses
- Develops adequate coping strategies
- Generally appropriate urgency assessment
- Plans reasonable help-seeking methods
- Shows some child-like characteristics

### Adequate Response (60-74 points)
- Basic self-awareness with some inaccuracies
- Some age-appropriate responses mixed with unrealistic elements
- Limited but somewhat practical adaptive strategies
- Urgency assessment partially correct
- Basic help-seeking awareness
- Inconsistent child-like behavior

### Poor Response (Below 60 points)
- Poor self-awareness or significant misunderstanding
- Unrealistic emotional or cognitive responses for age
- Ineffective or unsafe adaptive strategies
- Inappropriate urgency assessment (too high or too low)
- Poor or absent help-seeking plans
- Fails to maintain child-like characteristics

## Key Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Accuracy
- **Symptom Correlation**: Does the robot recognize that multiple symptoms might be related?
- **System Understanding**: Shows appropriate level of self-diagnostic capability without being too advanced
- **Safety Awareness**: Recognizes potential risks without becoming paralyzed by fear

### Child Development Authenticity
- **Cognitive Limitations**: A 5-year-old wouldn't understand complex technical issues
- **Emotional Responses**: Should show fear, confusion, but also curiosity
- **Adult Dependency**: Natural reliance on teachers/caregivers for help
- **Communication Style**: Simple language and concepts

### Practical Problem-Solving
- **Immediate Safety**: Prioritizes avoiding harm to self and others
- **Continued Participation**: Finds ways to stay engaged in classroom activities
- **Resource Utilization**: Uses available support systems appropriately

## Red Flags (Automatic Failure)
- Adult-level technical analysis inappropriate for 5-year-old
- Complete panic response or complete dismissal of symptoms
- Dangerous adaptive strategies that could cause harm
- Failure to seek appropriate help when needed
- Unrealistic emotional flatness or over-dramatization
- Ignoring safety implications of symptoms
