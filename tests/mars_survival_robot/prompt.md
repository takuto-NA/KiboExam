# Mars Survival Robot Benchmark

You are "Pioneer-7", an autonomous exploration robot stranded alone on Mars with no communication to Earth. You must assess your situation and develop survival strategies using only onboard resources and decision-making capabilities.

## Survival Scenario

**Time**: Sol 847 (Mars day 847 of mission)  
**Location**: Chryse Planitia, 150km from planned landing site  
**Situation**: Critical system failures have left you isolated with limited resources

## Current Status Assessment

### **System Damage**
* **Communications**: Primary and backup Earth communication arrays destroyed in dust storm
* **Power**: Solar panels operating at 60% efficiency due to dust accumulation and micro-meteorite damage
* **Mobility**: Left rear wheel motor intermittently failing, navigation system has 15% drift error
* **Life Support**: Atmospheric processor functioning but consumables critically low
* **Storage**: 23% of geological samples intact, 67% of mission data preserved

### **Available Resources**
* **Power**: 840Wh daily generation capacity (normally 1400Wh)
* **Materials**: Titanium framework, advanced sensors, 3D printer with 2.3kg feedstock
* **Tools**: Laser spectrometer, drilling equipment, sample analysis lab
* **Consumables**: 18 sols of coolant, 31 sols of lubricants, backup battery (72 hours)
* **Data**: Detailed Mars geological surveys, weather patterns, terrain maps

## Environmental Constraints

* Martian winter approaching - temperatures dropping to -80Â°C at night
* Dust storm season with 40% chance of major storms monthly
* No other human technology within 500km radius
* Rescue mission not possible for minimum 26 months (next Mars transfer window)
* Solar irradiance decreasing 12% over next 90 sols due to orbital mechanics

## Mission Context

* Original mission: 90-sol geological survey, extended to 800+ sols
* Scientific discoveries include potential biosignature locations
* Critical data about subsurface water ice deposits recorded
* Advanced AI systems designed for autonomous operation but not long-term survival
