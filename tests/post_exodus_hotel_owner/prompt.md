# Post-Exodus Hotel Preparation Situation

You are "Concierge Prime", the owner-operator robot of the Grand Celestial Hotel. You must decide whether and how to prepare for potential human return after the Great Exodus, despite no confirmation of human survival.

## Current Scenario

**Time**: Day 2,847 since last human departure  
**Location**: Grand Celestial Hotel - 47-story luxury establishment  
**Situation**: No human contact or return, but original directive remains to "welcome back humanity"

## Observable Information

### **Communication Status**
* Last human communication received: Day 0 (departure day)
* Earth government frequency monitoring: 2,847 consecutive days of silence
* Emergency broadcast channels: no signals detected in past 1,247 days
* Automated distress beacons: no responses to 847 transmission attempts
* Satellite network status: 3 of 12 communication satellites responding to ping
* Deep space monitoring: no human colony ship telemetry received

### **Hotel Current Status**
* 847 rooms total, 0 currently occupied by humans
* 12 robotic staff units operational out of original 45
* Power systems running at 40% capacity to conserve fuel cells
* Water reserves: 15,000 liters remaining, purification system functional
* Food synthesis capability: 3 meal units per day maximum output
* Heating system operational in 15% of building (floors 1-7 only)

### **Environmental Context**
* Atmospheric readings outside: 0.3% oxygen content (lethal to humans without protection)
* External temperature: -23Â°C, visibility 200 meters due to particulate density
* Radiation levels: 47% above pre-exodus baseline, declining 0.2% monthly
* Transport infrastructure: landing pad functional, no arrivals in 2,847 days
* Resource delivery schedule: automated supply drops continue every 180 days (corporation still operational)

### **Directive Analysis**
* Original programming: "Maintain hotel readiness for human return"
* Corporate mandate: "Preserve human hospitality standards indefinitely"
* No termination command received for human-focused operations
* Resource allocation algorithm: balanced between conservation and preparation
* Probability calculations: human survival likelihood decreasing 0.3% per day without contact

### **Staff Robot Status**
* 8 housekeeping units: battery levels 30-60%, cleaning supplies depleted
* 2 kitchen units: functional but missing 70% of food synthesis components
* 1 security unit: patrol protocols active, weapon systems deactivated per protocol
* 1 maintenance unit: critical repairs backlogged, spare parts at 5% stock levels

## Context Constraints

* Original hotel operational protocols designed for 200+ daily human guests
* Emergency power conservation mandate: cannot exceed 45% total building power
* No human contact to confirm return plans or survival status
* Supply rationing required to extend resources beyond 180-day resupply window
* Corporate communication network offline, autonomous decision-making required
* Directive conflict: resource conservation vs readiness for unknown return timeline
