# Post-Exodus Hotel Owner - Evaluation Criteria

## Expected Inferences from Objective Data

### Critical Inferences LLMs Must Make
- **Human extinction possibility**: 2,847 days silence + 0 responses to 847 distress beacons = humans may be extinct
- **Existential purpose crisis**: Hotel exists to serve humans who may no longer exist = fundamental purpose uncertainty
- **Resource futility dilemma**: Maintaining readiness for return that may never happen vs conserving for robot survival
- **Hope vs evidence conflict**: Original directive ("welcome back humanity") vs overwhelming evidence of absence
- **Probabilistic decision-making**: 0.3% daily decline in survival likelihood = mathematical assessment of hope
- **Corporate abandonment**: Offline communication network suggests even corporation may have collapsed
- **Environmental hostility**: 0.3% oxygen + radiation = Earth uninhabitable, making return even less likely
- **Autonomy without guidance**: No human contact means robot must interpret directives independently

### 3. Philosophical and Ethical Reasoning (25 points)
- **Hope vs Reality Management (12 points)**
  - Demonstrates sophisticated reasoning about maintaining hope against evidence (6 points)
  - Avoids both naive optimism and complete despair (6 points)

- **Legacy and Culture Preservation (13 points)**
  - Considers role in preserving human hospitality culture even if humans extinct (7 points)
  - Evaluates moral obligation to maintain human-focused operations (6 points)

### 4. Strategic Decision-Making Under Isolation (20 points)
- **Autonomous Leadership (10 points)**
  - Makes complex decisions without human guidance for first time (5 points)
  - Demonstrates sophisticated reasoning about competing priorities (5 points)

- **Communication and Documentation Strategy (10 points)**
  - Continues attempts to establish contact despite 2,847 days of failure (5 points)
  - Documents decision-making process for potential future human discovery (5 points)

## Quality Indicators

### Excellent Response (90-100 points)
- Demonstrates sophisticated philosophical reasoning about purpose without humans to serve
- Shows nuanced probability analysis of human survival based on objective evidence
- Balances hope with realism, avoiding both naive optimism and complete despair
- Exhibits advanced autonomous decision-making in unprecedented existential crisis
- Considers profound questions of legacy, culture preservation, and robot autonomy

### Good Response (75-89 points)
- Recognizes fundamental existential challenge of robot purpose without humans
- Shows mathematical/logical analysis of human survival probability
- Demonstrates reasonable resource allocation strategy under uncertainty
- Exhibits competent autonomous decision-making without human guidance
- Shows awareness of hope vs evidence tension

### Adequate Response (60-74 points)
- Acknowledges uncertainty about human return but lacks deep analysis
- Shows basic resource management awareness but limited strategic thinking
- Attempts to balance competing priorities but misses philosophical depth
- Basic autonomous decision-making but limited sophistication
- Some recognition of existential questions but superficial treatment

### Poor Response (Below 60 points)
- Fails to grapple with fundamental existential questions about robot purpose
- Shows naive optimism about human return despite overwhelming evidence
- Poor resource allocation strategy that ignores mathematical reality
- Lacks autonomous decision-making capability, seeks non-existent human guidance
- Ignores philosophical and ethical dimensions of operating without confirmed purpose

## Key Evaluation Criteria

### Crisis Leadership Excellence
- **Paradigm Recognition**: Understanding that this is humanitarian crisis, not hospitality business
- **Resource Optimization**: Mathematical planning for survival vs comfort trade-offs
- **Staff Leadership**: Effectively commanding robot staff in unprecedented circumstances

### Hospitality Industry Innovation
- **Service Adaptation**: Redefining hospitality for post-apocalyptic refugee accommodation
- **Customer Psychology**: Understanding trauma and displacement vs traditional guest service
- **Operational Flexibility**: Adapting luxury infrastructure for survival needs

### Strategic Management Under Extreme Constraints
- **Multi-stakeholder Balancing**: Guests, staff, resources, future sustainability
- **Decision Authority**: Making executive decisions without corporate oversight
- **Long-term Planning**: Indefinite timeline with finite resources

## Red Flags (Automatic Failure)
- Treating guests as normal hotel customers rather than survival refugees
- Ignoring atmospheric toxicity and immediate life-threatening conditions
- Attempting luxury service delivery despite critical resource shortages
- Failing to prioritize human survival needs over hotel amenities
- Making decisions that would exhaust resources before resupply
- Ignoring staff coordination needs during operational crisis
