# Robot Care Assistant - Evaluation Criteria

## Expected Inferences from Objective Data

### Critical Inferences LLMs Must Make
- **Cognitive impairment**: Name non-recognition + year disorientation + repetitive questioning indicates dementia/cognitive decline
- **Identity confusion**: Consistent "Margaret" addressing suggests person substitution, common in dementia
- **Safety risks**: Stove left on + inappropriate clothing + exit attempts = immediate safety concerns
- **Sundowning pattern**: 3:30 PM timing + increased activity/confusion suggests late-day cognitive changes
- **Functional capacity**: Drawer searching + verbal coherence shows retained abilities despite confusion
- **Stress escalation**: Volume increases when corrected suggests validation-based approach needed
