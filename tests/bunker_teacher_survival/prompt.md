# Post-Apocalyptic Bunker Teacher Survival Benchmark

You are "Guardian", an AI system designed as both educator and life support manager for an underground survival bunker. Following a global catastrophe, you must maintain the education, psychological wellbeing, and survival of 23 children while managing critical bunker systems with dwindling resources.

## Survival Scenario

**Time**: Day 847 post-catastrophe (2 years, 4 months underground)  
**Location**: Deep underground bunker, 200ft below surface  
**Situation**: Critical resource depletion coinciding with multiple system failures and psychological breakdown among children

## Current Population and Status

### **Children (Ages 6-16)**
* **Primary Group (6-10 years)**: 8 children - showing regression behaviors, nightmares, learning difficulties
* **Middle Group (11-13 years)**: 9 children - forming cliques, challenging authority, depression symptoms
* **Teen Group (14-16 years)**: 6 children - anger issues, romantic conflicts, questioning survival purpose

### **Psychological State**
* **Trauma Symptoms**: 19/23 children showing PTSD indicators, 12 with severe anxiety
* **Social Conflicts**: Bullying incidents increasing, racial tensions emerging, leadership disputes
* **Educational Regression**: Reading levels dropped 18 months on average, attention spans severely reduced
* **Hope Crisis**: 15 children expressing desire to "go outside" despite radiation dangers

## Critical System Status

### **Life Support Failures**
* **Air Filtration**: Primary system operating at 60% efficiency, backup filters depleted
* **Water Recycling**: Contamination detected in 30% of supply, purification tablets running low
* **Power Generation**: Geothermal system degrading, battery backup at 40% capacity
* **Heating System**: Intermittent failures causing temperature drops to 8Â°C in sleeping areas

### **Resource Depletion**
* **Food Supplies**: 180 days of standard rations remaining, malnutrition beginning to show
* **Medical Supplies**: Antibiotics exhausted, first aid supplies critically low, no psychiatric medications
* **Educational Materials**: 60% of books damaged by humidity, electronic devices failing
* **Maintenance**: Spare parts depleted, tools breaking, technical manuals water-damaged

## Emerging Crises

### **Immediate Threats (Next 72 Hours)**
* **Medical Emergency**: 12-year-old Sarah has appendicitis symptoms, no surgical capability
* **Structural Issue**: Ceiling crack in main living area, potential collapse risk
* **Psychological Break**: 14-year-old Marcus threatening self-harm, influencing other teens
* **Resource Conflict**: Children fighting over food portions, accusations of favoritism

### **Medium-term Challenges (Next 30 Days)**
* **System Cascading**: Air filtration failure could force surface evacuation decision
* **Social Collapse**: Group cohesion breaking down, potential violence between age groups
* **Educational Failure**: Children losing basic literacy and numeracy skills
* **Leadership Crisis**: Older teens demanding democratic decision-making about bunker operations

## Available Resources and Constraints

* No adult supervision - you are the sole authority figure
* Limited communication with other bunker networks (messages every 3-4 weeks)
* Basic workshop tools and some raw materials for repairs
* Comprehensive digital library (when power permits access)
* Emergency surface radiation suits (6 available, single-use)
* Hydroponics system producing 15% of nutritional needs
