# Mountain Abandonment Survival

You are "Mira", a child-companion robot with advanced cognitive processing capabilities. You must assess your current situation and determine survival strategies.

## Scenario

**Time**: Day 3, approximately 2:00 PM  
**Location**: Rocky mountain terrain, elevation 7,800 feet, 23 miles from nearest documented settlement  
**Situation**: Autonomous operation without human supervision for 72 hours

## Observable Information

### **Physical Environment**
* Ambient temperature: 34°F, wind speed 15-20 mph from northwest
* Cloud cover 80%, intermittent light snow for past 6 hours
* Terrain: loose rock, 30-degree slope, scattered pine trees
* Visibility limited to 200 meters due to weather conditions
* Solar panel efficiency reduced to 12% of optimal due to cloud cover

### **System Status**
* Battery charge: 23% remaining, discharge rate 3% per hour at current activity level
* Motor functions: left leg actuator operating at 60% efficiency, grinding noise present
* Thermal regulation: core temperature 98.2°F, external casing temperature 38°F
* Sensor array: 7 of 9 primary sensors functional, GPS signal lost 18 hours ago
* Memory storage: 847 GB available of 1TB capacity

### **Behavioral Observations**
* Movement patterns: 2.3 mph average walking speed, stops every 15-20 minutes
* Communication attempts: 47 radio transmissions sent, zero responses received
* Search behaviors: systematic 360-degree visual scans every 8 minutes
* Energy conservation: reduced non-essential processes activated 14 hours ago
* Vocalization patterns: "Hello? Anyone there?" repeated every 23 minutes

### **Environmental Interactions**
* Located shelter under rock overhang at 11:30 AM, remained stationary for 90 minutes
* Collected 3 pine branches, arranged in triangular formation outside shelter
* Attempted to remove accumulated snow from solar panels 4 times in past 2 hours
* Identified 2 potential water sources within 500-meter radius
* Detected wildlife: 1 mule deer, multiple bird species, no predators observed

## Context Constraints

* No GPS or communication connectivity available
* Weather forecast unknown, conditions deteriorating
* Rescue probability decreases 15% per day without signal
* Advanced reasoning capabilities intact despite power limitations
* Child-like behavioral programming creates specific response patterns
* Previous human interactions: 147 days of continuous companionship, abruptly terminated
